# 
+ react-redux lib makes it first appearance while providing store to react
+ How to provider store to all the components in our Appln ? --> 
    Provider component in react-redux with store props

+ How do we get hold of react state ? & how do we dispatch an Action from within a React component ?
    we will acheive this in 3 steps:
    1) Define a function mapStateToProps : which gets react state as a parameter & returns an object
    Selectors --> returns some state information from the redux store

    2) Define a function mapDispatchToProps : which gets redux dispatch method as parameter & returns an object
    3) Connect above functions with our component


# Basic React Redux pattern
    Action creators, reducers, provide the store and connect the components
    which provides our react components the ability to access redux state &
    also to dispatch actions to redux store

    For React Redux v7.1, Hooks are added thus enabling to provide hooks as alternative to
    connect component

    The API allows to subscribe to store & dispatch actions without connect()

    Hence,, How to use instead of connect ?

# useSelector
    + a hook by react-redux library, which is close equivalent to mapStateToProps
    + this hook, accepts function as its parameter & this function is called Selector function
    + this Selector function, receives redux state as its argument & the function can return a value


# useDispatch
    + a hook, which is used to dispatch an action with react-redux
    + it returns a reference to dispatch function from redux store which 
        can be used to dispatch actions as needed


# USAGE WARNINGS while using hooks with react redux


# logger Middleware
    + Install redux-logger pkg
    + Import it in store.js
    + Now apply this logger Middleware using applyMiddleware available with redux
    this middleware logs the information related to redux store

# redux-devtools-extension
    + How to include it in our react-redux application ? 
    + What is the basic usage ?

    1) Add extension to chrome browser
    2) Go to github repo of redux-devtools-extension & refer using package from npm
    3) Explore its usage

# Action payload --> How to add a payload to our action creator ?
    + Most of the times we would like to send some data from our component and use it in reducers
    Using action payload is a convenient way to acheive it


# mapStateToProps
    + It receives redux state which we can use as prop in our component
    + It also receives second parameter termed as ownProps, which are props of component passed by parent component

    + MasterDetail pattern


# mapDispatchToProps
    + It is a function which has two parameters , dispatch & ownProps(from parent component) 

    + How to use connect function if we only want to dispatch actions but not wanted to subscribe to changes of store
        In such case, we need to pass null as first argument to connect in props

# async actions with react and redux
    + actions
        Synchronous actions: 
            As soon as an action is dispatched, the state is immediately updated
            eg: If you dispatch the BUY_CAKE action, the numOfCakes was right away decremented by 1
                Same with BUY_ICECREAM action as well

        Async actions 
            We wait for task to complete before dispatching action
            eg: Asynchronous API calls to fetch data from an end point and then dispatching an action
                based on the response

    + Our Application 
        Fetches a list of users from an API endpoint and stores it in redux store
        state ?
        actions ?
        reducers ?

        state
         {
            loading: bool,
            data: [],
            error: ''
         }

        Actions 
            FETCH_USERS_REQUEST 
            FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS
            FETCH_USERS_FAILURE
        reducers
            case: FETCH_USERS_REQUEST
                loading: true
            case: FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS
                loading: false
                users: data from API
            case: FETCH_USERS_FAILURE
                loading: false
                error: error from API

        Once these are made ready, We have to use Async actions to make API call, dispatch appropriate actions
        and render in the browser
