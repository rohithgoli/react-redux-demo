# 
+ react-redux lib makes it first appearance while providing store to react
+ How to provider store to all the components in our Appln ? --> 
    Provider component in react-redux with store props

+ How do we get hold of react state ? & how do we dispatch an Action from within a React component ?
    we will acheive this in 3 steps:
    1) Define a function mapStateToProps : which gets react state as a parameter & returns an object
    Selectors --> returns some state information from the redux store

    2) Define a function mapDispatchToProps : which gets redux dispatch method as parameter & returns an object
    3) Connect above functions with our component
