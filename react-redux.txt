# 
+ react-redux lib makes it first appearance while providing store to react
+ How to provider store to all the components in our Appln ? --> 
    Provider component in react-redux with store props

+ How do we get hold of react state ? & how do we dispatch an Action from within a React component ?
    we will acheive this in 3 steps:
    1) Define a function mapStateToProps : which gets react state as a parameter & returns an object
    Selectors --> returns some state information from the redux store

    2) Define a function mapDispatchToProps : which gets redux dispatch method as parameter & returns an object
    3) Connect above functions with our component


# Basic React Redux pattern
    Action creators, reducers, provide the store and connect the components
    which provides our react components the ability to access redux state &
    also to dispatch actions to redux store

    For React Redux v7.1, Hooks are added thus enabling to provide hooks as alternative to
    connect component

    The API allows to subscribe to store & dispatch actions without connect()

    Hence,, How to use instead of connect ?

# useSelector
    + a hook by react-redux library, which is close equivalent to mapStateToProps
    + this hook, accepts function as its parameter & this function is called Selector function
    + this Selector function, receives redux state as its argument & the function can return a value
